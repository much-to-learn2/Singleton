Python Singleton class explanation

The class _NoValueType from NumPy uses this implementation.

While the Singleton concept is a simple one (all objects of type share the
same instance), it's implementation in Python is pretty confusing to me.
So, using the answers from stack overflow, I've decided to annotate an 
implementation of the Singleton class.
